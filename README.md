# Celestial Bodies Database

In this project project I created a relational database through FreeCodeCamp in PostgreSQL. This database contains five tables: galaxy, star, planet, moon, and planet_type. This database is normalized and the tables are connected via their relations through primary and foreign keys. A grading rubric provided by FreeCodeCamp was utilized to utilize a variety of data types, and a variety among the tables themselves. The code provided are the commands from the dump from my completed database. This was completed through a virtual machine provided by FreeCodeCamp that utilizes PostgreSQL and VS Code.
